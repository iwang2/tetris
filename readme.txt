SAD TETRIS
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to play a cool tetris game, you're fresh out
of luck on this one.

In SAD TETRIS, your lines are never cleared. This means, all
you can do is sadly watch your pieces as the stack fails to
grow shorter.

How To Play:
To move your piece left or right, use the right and left
arrow keys. To rotate, press the up arrow key. If you rotate
too fast, the piece may become distorted (oops??).
