SQUARE TETRIS
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to play a cool tetris game, you're fresh out
of luck on this one.

In square tetris, the only piece shape available is the 
O-block, and your lines are never cleared.

To move your piece left or right, use the right and left 
arrow keys.
